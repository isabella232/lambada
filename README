Lambada - Automated Deployment of Python Methods to the (Lambda) Cloud
Copyright (C) 2016 Josef Spillner <xmpp:josef.spillner@swissjabber.ch>
======================================================================

Lambada is a Python module which dynamically re-wites any module or
script it is included in so that all functions become externalised (if
feasible), deployed to AWS Lambda, and automatically executed there.

Instructions:
- Create an account at AWS
- Configure lambda so that e.g. `aws lambda list-functions' works
- Configure to have at least one dedicated execution role, and enter its
  unique number (ARN)
  * as environment variable: LAMBADAROLEARN=..., e.g. through wrapper
    script `run.sh'
  * as parameter to lambada.move(lambdarolearn=...)

Interesting files:
- lambada.py: main module file
- myapp.py: sample lambada-fied application script
- myapp-tests.py: full unit test coverage for the sample script
- values.csv: sample data for the sample script

Not so interesting files:
- codegen.py: external, from https://github.com/andreif/codegen, with
  some limitations, e.g. `with'
- functions/: directory with some testing scripts, can be ignored
- README: you're reading it right now
